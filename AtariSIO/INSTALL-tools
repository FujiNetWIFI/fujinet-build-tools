AtariSIO tools-only installation

Copyright (C) 2018-2019 Matthias Reichl <hias@horus.com>

If you only want to build the tools adir, ataricom and dir2atr
follow the instructions in this file. If you want to build
the full AtariSIO suite for Linux, including the kernel driver,
atariserver and atarixfer please refer to "INSTALL".

Prerequisites:
==============

You need a posix compliant system like Linux, BSD, OS X or Cygwin
to compile the tools.

You also need the following development tools installed:
- make
- a C++ compiler, eg GNU g++ or Clang clang++
- C++ development headers and libraries

Building:
=========

Instead of using the main Makefile in the source root use
Makefile.posix from the tools directory

cd tools
make -f Makefile.posix

This will compile the tools using the default C++ compiler, which
is typically g++ or c++ and create 3 executables, adir, ataricom
and dir2atr in the directory.

To use a different C++ compiler set the CXX variable. eg to use Clang:

make -f Makefile.posix CXX=clang++

The makefile rules also honor the CXXFLAGS and LDFLAGS variables
in case you need to change them.

To clean the source directory (i.e. delete the executables) use
the clean target.

make -f Makefile.posix clean

Installing the binaries:
========================

You can either copy the 3 binaries manually to your desired
location (/usr/local/bin, ${HOME}/bin, ...) or use the install
target of the Makefile.

To install to the default location, /usr/local/bin, run

make -f Makefile.posix install

The install location can be changed via the INSTALLDIR variable.
eg if you want to install the binaries to /opt/atari/bin run this command

make -f Makefile.posix install INSTALLDIR=/opt/atari/bin
