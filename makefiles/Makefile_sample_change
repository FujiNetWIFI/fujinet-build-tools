# Sample Makefile for FUFMF - Fenrocks Ultimate Fuji Make Files
#
# Copy this Makefile to your local project and edit as needed. It works with cc65 and this repo to create clean
# easy builds that will pull down fujinet-lib for you automatically...
#
# Set the TARGETS and PROGRAM values as required.
# See makefiles/build.mk for details on directory structure for src files and how to add custom extensions to the build.
#

TARGETS = apple2enh apple2
PROGRAM := weather

# EDIT THIS 
export FUJINET_BUILD_TOOLS_DIR := ../../fujinet-build-tools
