# src/common

Common code that will be compiled on every target can go in this directory, or any sub-directory.
It does not have to stay in the root src/common folder, but can be split into functional sub-directories.

This is also a good folder for header files, where you have a common function, but implementations are in the platform or target sub-directories.
