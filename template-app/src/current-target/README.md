# current-target

This folder can contain subdirectories for the specific target being built if needed (e.g. "apple2enh").
This allows for "apple2" target and "apple2enh" to be separate by directly where needed, whereas the
subdirectory "src/apple2" is a platform level directory containing code for both "apple2" AND "apple2enh".
